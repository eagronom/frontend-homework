## Introduction

You should have link to the design and requirements about what needs to be done.
If you do not have them then please contact us and we will provide them.

This codebase is setup based on what is our FE stack in eAgronom.
As you can see we use:
- React with Redux
- Typescript
- SCSS

It would be awesome if you complete this homework with this stack.

As you might be more comfortable with different stack then it is okay to use:
- JS instead of TS
- CSS, styled-components etc instead of SCSS

Have fun and godspeed!
